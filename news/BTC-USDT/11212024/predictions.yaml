  preview: Nvidia's Q3 revenue surges, surpasses expectations.
  fullContent: "Nvidia Corporation announced on Wednesday a significant 95% increase\
    \ in revenue for the third quarter of 2024, reaching $35.1 billion and surpassing\
    \ previous predictions. For the fourth quarter, Nvidia projects revenue of $37.5\
    \ billion. Nvidia Q3 Revenue Reflects Strong Demand for AI The company\u2019s\
    \ Data Center segment led the growth with a 111% jump to $30.8 billion compared\
    \ to the previous year. Gaming, Professional Visualization, and Automotive segments\
    \ also recorded increases of 14%, 16%, and 72%, respectively. Nvidia\u2019s stock\
    \ prices have also increased by nearly 30% throughout Q3, and nearly 200% this\
    \ year. The company\u2019s performance is likely driven by the surging demand\
    \ for Bitcoin mining and AI. \u201CThe age of AI is in full steam, propelling\
    \ a global shift to NVIDIA computing,\u201D founder and CEO Jensen Huang noted\
    \ in a press release. Also, the company has continued to dominate the GPU mining\
    \ market. According to the latest data, its RTX hardware has consecutively outperformed\
    \ any other products in the market in terms of GPU mining profitability. GPU profitability\
    \ ranking as of November 2024. Source: What To Mine Exploring Other Business Avenues\
    \ Amidst its surging revenue, Nvidia has been looking into new business avenues\
    \ throughout the year. The company is venturing into humanoid robotics. The development\
    \ aims to equip developers with tools to train robots using data from human demonstrations.\
    \ Earlier this year, Nvidia\u2019s market capitalization surpassed the combined\
    \ value of all Russell 2000 stocks by $10 billion, accounting for 43% of the S&amp;P\
    \ 500\u2019s gains. However, the company is facing regulatory challenges due to\
    \ its strong association with crypto mining. In September, the Department of Justice\
    \ (DOJ) issued a subpoena as part of an antitrust investigation. The case is reportedly\
    \ looking into whether Nvidia\u2019s practices limit competition in sectors like\
    \ crypto and AI. Most recently, the Supreme Court indicated that it may issue\
    \ a narrow ruling in a shareholder lawsuit. The lawsuit accuses Nvidia of misrepresenting\
    \ its dependence on crypto mining revenue to investors."
