  preview: Network Achieves Landmark Amidst Copying Allegations
  fullContent: "Coinbase\u2019s Ethereum Layer-2 network, Base, found itself at the\
    \ center of controversy during the celebration of its 1 billionth transaction.\
    \ The celebration included the release of an NFT, which inadvertently copied the\
    \ work of digital artist Chris Biron. Base Hits 1 Billion Transaction On November\
    \ 15, Coinbase-backed Base proudly announced that it had completed 1 billion transactions\
    \ since its launch in August 2023. This milestone was achieved in just over a\
    \ year, a remarkable feat compared to established networks like Bitcoin, which\
    \ took more than 15 years to reach similar numbers. Base\u2019s rapid rise is\
    \ no surprise. The network has quickly become the fastest-growing Ethereum layer-2\
    \ solution, surpassing competitors like Optimism and Arbitrum. A recent report\
    \ by CoinGecko ranked Base as the second most popular blockchain in 2024, with\
    \ the network now capturing nine times more interest than its closest Layer-2\
    \ competitor, Arbitrum. \u201CBase ecosystem has seen its share of investor interest\
    \ increase by over 5 times since Q1, raising the layer 2 ecosystem\u2019s ranking\
    \ from seventh to second, and overtaking its layer 1 Ethereum ecosystem. This\
    \ also means that the Base ecosystem now captures 9 times more interest than the\
    \ next most popular layer 2 ecosystem Arbitrum,\u201D Coingecko stated. Base\u2019\
    s Total Value Locked. Source: L2Beat Market observers have attributed the network\u2019\
    s rapid growth to the robust support and resources provided by Coinbase, the $76\
    \ billion crypto exchange that operates Base. Moreover, Coinbase brand power as\
    \ the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the US has also undoubtedly contributed\
    \ to Base success. NFT Controversy and Apology To commemorate the 1 billion transaction\
    \ achievement, Base minted an NFT. However, the artwork bore a striking resemblance\
    \ to a creation by digital artist Chris Biron, who accused the network of copying\
    \ his work without credit. Biron claimed that Base had already earned over $36,000\
    \ in profits from the NFT at the time of his complaint. \u201CI usually like it\
    \ when someone recreates/remixes my work. But when a 76 billion dollar corporation\
    \ copies it, sells it, and gets $36k+ in profit without attributing me at all,\
    \ it feels less fun,\u201D Biron stated. In response to the backlash, Base lead\
    \ developer Jesse Pollak issued a public apology, explaining that the incident\
    \ was unintentional. The Coinbase-backed network also admitted that its artwork\
    \ unintentionally mirrored Biron\u2019s work and promised to improve its processes\
    \ to prevent similar issues in the future. \u201CCreativity often draws from a\
    \ pool of shared inspiration, and while designing this piece we unintentionally\
    \ mirrored the work of another artist without attribution We\u2019re sorry, and\
    \ we\u2019ll be sending 100% of the proceeds to Biron,\u201D Base wrote. Biron\
    \ appreciated Base\u2019s response, calling it a \u201Cclass act\u201D and praising\
    \ the team for respectfully handling the situation."
